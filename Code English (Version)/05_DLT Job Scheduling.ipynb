    "To run the workflow defined in the *POS 03* and *POS 04* notebooks, we need to schedule them as a [DLT pipeline](https://docs.databricks.com/data-engineering/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-ui.html). Using the Jobs UI within the Databricks workspace, we can click on the Delta Live Tables tab and click *Create Pipeline*.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "Because we are using the *apply_changes()* functionality in *POS 03*, we need to click *Add Configuration* and set a key and value of *pipelines.applyChangesPreviewEnabled* and *true*, respectively.  (This requirement will likely change at a future date.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under *Target*, we specify the name of the database within which DLT objects created in these workflows should reside. If we accept the defaults associated with this demo, that database is *pos_dlt*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under *Storage Location*, we specify the storage location where object data and metadata will be placed.  Again, our *POS 01* notebook expects this to be */mnt/pos/dlt_pipeline*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under *Pipeline Mode*, we specify how the cluster that runs our job will be managed.  If we select *Triggered*, the cluster shuts down with each cycle.  As several of our DLT objects are configured to run continuously, we should select *Continuous* mode. In our DLT object definitions, we leveraged some throttling techniques to ensure our workflows do not become overwhelmed with data.  Still, there will be some variability in terms of data moving through our pipelines so we might specify a minimum and maximum number of workers within a reasonable range based on our expectations for the data.  Once deployed, we might monitor resource utilization to determine if this range should be adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** Continuous jobs will run indefinitely until explicitly stopped.  Please be aware of this as you manage your DLT pipelines.\n",
